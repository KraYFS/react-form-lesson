# React + Vite + react-hook-form

## Team Principles & Rules

1. Branch Naming
   • Create a new branch for each task or issue (e.g., `login`, `page-404`, `usage-alerts`).
   • Use nouns and hyphens to separate words.

2. Naming Conventions
   • Folders: Always lowercase (e.g., `/src/components`, `/src/pages`).
   • Components: Always start with a capital letter (e.g., `Button`, `ErrorPage`).

3. Code Testing

   Before pushing code, test it on:
   • Two desktop browsers (at least Chrome & Firefox).
   • Two other devices (Tablet & iPhone).

4. Unit Tests
   • Add unit tests whenever possible.
   • Run all tests locally before pushing code.

5. Pull Requests (PRs)
   • Keep PRs small for better code quality.
   • PR titles should use nouns.
   • Descriptions are optional.
   • Ensure no failed checks (CodeFactor, Codacy, workflows, etc.).
